okay wow i thought i knew about modular number systems but i couldnt get this one to work. The basic logic is fine, interface type monkey and then pass functors to make it simple operations etc. But the modulo bit in part2 got me stuck, tried big ints to no avail, they just failed due to overflow. Crazy question, glad im done.
