I honestly struggled with this one a little bit, i think since i was trying to do some funny logic with bools and i could have just made a simpler solution as this wasnt fun to make nor was it a good solution.

Cool problem though, makes me think about mod 3 maths, or some kind of inline evaluator using map, maybe summing all the used hands and the win/draw cases separately? Might be a good one to come back to or use as an interview question. 

Will be looking out for cool solutions.
